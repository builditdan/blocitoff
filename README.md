### Background and General Information
I built this application during my Ruby on Rails training with [bloc.io](https://bloc.io).

It is a website where you can enter tasks and they will automatically self-destruct in 7 days. By automatically deleting the tasks it provides you that motivation to get your tasks done before they expire.

### Design Information
I used [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to aide in design and layout. I leveraged gems [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and [pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) for account management. Gained more hands-on experience using [partials](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials) to keep my code dry.

To create a more dynamic feel to the task list I used [Ajax](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html) to add and mark tasks complete without having to do a page refresh. To keep those tasks expiring - I created a custom [Rake](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rake) job that would purge tasks after seven days.

### Highlights on Gem's used
* [`rspec`](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) for testing
* [`postgres`](http://www.postgresql.org/) for my production database, mysql for development
* [`devise`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to aide in account management
* [`pundit`](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) to aide in security policies
* [`redcarpet`](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) for handling markdown
* [`byebug`](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) debugging helper
* [`better_errors`](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) better error messages
* [`binding_of_caller`](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller) better debug messages
* [`faker`](https://github.com/stympy/faker) handy gem for generating fake data

### Additional comments
It is NOT a responsive site so additional work would be needed in that area.

The Rake task that purges expired tasks only runs manually. A future enhancement would be to add it to scheduler like [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
